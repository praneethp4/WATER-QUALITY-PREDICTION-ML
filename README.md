# WATER-QUALITY-PREDICTION-ML
## Problem Statement
Here and there we see people dying due to intaking impure water which is a misfortune. Water in some areas it might be good or bad based on impurity
present in it. So we want to classify whether water is safe for comsumption or not basing on level of impurity. For a large set of data and preprocessed data
and made visualisation for easy understanding of data then we put those data in different machine learning classification models and finding out the best
model to predict the category of customers.
## Dataset
Dataset used in the project represents approximately 8000 samples of water in an urban environment, with their individual concentration.
The Dependent variable is named as column "is_safe" which has 2 classes in the data, both in the training and testing sets:
Class 0 represents water that is NOT suitable
Class 1 represents water that is suitable
## Preprocessing
#### •	Converted attributes to float.
#### •	Removed NAN values.
#### •	Normalizing The dataset.
#### •	Standardizing the dataset
#### •	Removing outliers using Inter Quartile Range.

## DATA VISULIZATION 
We visualized data using 
#### •	Plot box
#### •	Pair plot
#### •	Matshow
#### •	Heatmap
#### •	Scatter_matrix
#### •	Count plot for dependent feature

 ## Learning Algorithms used
 ### Logistic Regresssion
 ### SVM
 ### Decision Tree
 ### Random Forest Classifier
