# WATER-QUALITY-PREDICTION-ML
## Problem Statement
Here and there we see people dying due to intaking impure water which is a misfortune. Water in some areas it might be good or bad based on impurity
present in it. So we want to classify whether water is safe for comsumption or not basing on level of impurity. For a large set of data and preprocessed data
and made visualisation for easy understanding of data then we put those data in different machine learning classification models and finding out the best
model to predict the category of customers.
